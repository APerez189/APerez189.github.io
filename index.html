                    You are a new student on UofSCs campus and you want to start networking with others, but you are having trouble connecting with people, or you are having a problem with finding things to do on campus. Our solution is to create an app that allows users to connect with their peers, professors, alumni, clubs, workplaces, etcâ€¦ on campus.
